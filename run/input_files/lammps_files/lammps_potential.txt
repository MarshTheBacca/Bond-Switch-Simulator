# Remember, all units are the electron style, so Energy is in Hatrees, distances in Bohr radii and angles in degrees

# The potential is E = U(min) / (r0 -rC)^2 ((r-r0)^2 - (rC-r0)^2)
# The numbers in the bond_coeff command correspond to: Minimum energy (U(min)), equilibrium bond length (r0) and the critical distance (rC), at which the potential = 0
