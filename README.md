# LAMMPS Network Monte Carlo

This is a fork of the Wilson Group's [2D Network Monte Carlo](https://github.com/WilsonGroupOxford/Network-Monte-Carlo) repository that integrates [LAMMPS](https://github.com/lammps/lammps) to allow for faster energy evaluation and other 2D structures:

* Silica Bilayers (Si2O3)
* Triangle Rafts (SiO2)
* Tersoff Graphene (C)
* Boron Nitride (BN)

Credit must be given to [Oliver Whitaker](https://github.com/oliwhitg) for implementing LAMMPS and [David Ormrod Morley](https://github.com/dormrod) for the origial code.
