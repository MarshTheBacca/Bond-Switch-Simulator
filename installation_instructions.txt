Download Open MPI from https://www.open-mpi.org/
Install it by extracting to a folder, making a new directory called 'build'
Go into 'build', enter "../configure 2>&1 | tee config.out"
enter "make -j 4 all 2>&1 | tee make.out"
emter "make install 2>&1 | tee install.out"

You may have to install python dependencies if you encounter errors, like I had to install sphinx_rtd_theme using "pip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme"
If you still encounter an error with sphinx_rtd_theme, then enter "pip3 show sphinx_rtd_theme" to find where it is installed, then edit ~/.bashrc and add the line "export PYTHON_PATH="<path>:$PYTHON_PATH""
Then enter "source ~/.bashrc" to execute this (and it will automatically execute everytime you log on)

Now download lammps from https://www.lammps.org/ from source, either as a tar.gz or from their github using "git clone ..."
Make a directory in the lammps files called build
enter "cmake ../cmake -D BUILD_SHARED=ON"
enter "cmake --build . -j 4"
enter "cmake --install ."

by default, things will be installed to ~./local/lib, and you need to add another line to ~/.bashrc "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$HOME/.local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH""
Now if you enter "pkg-config --list-all | grep liblammps" you should see liblammps is a recognised package.
